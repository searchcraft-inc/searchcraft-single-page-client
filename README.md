# Searchcraft Single Page Client

## What is it?

A stand-alone, zero dependency HTML page that can act as a search query UI for Searchcraft to run search queries against the Searchcraft Core API. The controls are minimal, you can set the total results per page and toggle between fuzzy and exact match searches.

## How to configure it?

Simply add your endpoint url, index RESTful name and read key. If you configured your index in Vektron, this information is in your code snippets panel. If you are running Searchcraft locally you should have these already. The values are stored in local storage so they are retained between page refreshes. There are no NPM packages to install or external dependencies, just a single HTML page that you load into your browser.
